# Presentation Banque de France - Using deep learning to solve life-cycle models

This repository shows how to solve a simple buffer-stock model using deep-learning. It uses the `EconDLSolvers` that implements the algorithms in Druedahl, RÃ¸pke (2024). 

To run the notebooks,  you need to install the following packages:

- `torch` (informations [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch))
- `EconModel` (informations [here](https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/EconModel))
- `Consav` (informations [here](https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/ConsumptionSaving))
- `EconDLSolvers` (informations [here](https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/EconDLSolvers))
